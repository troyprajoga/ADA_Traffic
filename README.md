How to use program:

Left click to set Start point

Right click to set End point

Press Space to run DFS algorithm

Press R to see Final Path of DFS algorithm

Press O to run Optimized DFS algorithm

Press P to see Final path of Optimized DFS algorithm

NOTE:
In the terminal it will show the total path that the algorithm travelled to find the end point as well as the final path which has accounted for weights.
Weights simulate traffic congestion where black roads are 1x, yellow roads are 1.3x, orange roads are 1.6x, and red roads are 2x
